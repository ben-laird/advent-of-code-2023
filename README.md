# Advent of Code 2023

Welcome to my attempt at the Advent of Code 2023 challenge!

## Goals

I will primarily be focusing on learning:

- Data structures
- The ropes of AOC
- Rust programming

### Stretch Goals

I would also like to:

- Learn Zig
- Learn Go
- Build a website housing my notes and thoughts on AOC 2023

## Tech Stack

### Languages

I will attempt each day in at least TypeScript and Rust, my strongest language and my most anticipated language as of writing. I may make additional passes in Zig or Go, but those will only be stretch goals. I currently want to learn about data structures and algorithms through Rust and TypeScript, and I intend to use my knowledge of TS to ease developing in Rust and utilizing data structures.

### Tooling

I primarily use Deno for TS and the standard Rust toolchain for my Rust projects. If I end up making a website, it will likely be with Astro and Deno.

## Support

If you like my work, consider starring/forking this repo or [buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/benlaird), _but only if you want to_. Any support or encouragement is greatly appreciated! PR's are also welcome! If you have a way to improve my work that I can learn from, I'd greatly appreciate a pull request; I always enjoy learning better solutions to problems.
